# ProjectDiscoveryInstaller
I am no longer supporting this project. ProjectDiscovery has created a great tool to install their tools so check that out here - https://github.com/projectdiscovery/pdtm

I created this script to quickly install the most recent version of Golang and the ProjectDiscovery tools that I found my self constantly installing on new machines. 

The following tools will be installed on your machine:
